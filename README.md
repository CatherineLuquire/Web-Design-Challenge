# Web-Design-Challenge
I originally had the files in the structure of the instructions but I was unable to make my github website work properly without the index file in the main folder, so I moved all the HTML files and the CSS stylesheet over.

The index.html is the landing page. The nav bar is the same structure throughout the all the pages. 

I updated the csv file to the file from my own Python API project.

The ipynb file is the pandas file to convert the csv to html
